## Badges
### A. General Skills
- **Jupyter 101**: Getting to know the awesome campus resource given to every student at Cal. Datahub is a free server you usually use for classes like Data 8/100, that you can also use for whatever you want! <br>
- **GIT + BASH 101**: The absolute basics of bash scripting and the usage of git to get you started with navigating, organizing, and versioning your computational projects!<br>

### B. Team-Specific Badges
- **Natural Language Processing**: General concepts involved in the broad field of natural language processing, which involves taking in text as input and subsequently making use of it for various tasks.<br>
- **BERT**: In this course, you will learn how to implement BERT, a deep learning implementation of transformers specialized in dealing with textual data, as used by our NLP team.<br>
- **CHEMINFORMATICS**: This course will let you go through the NLP Team's workflow and concepts related to the programmatic application of our domain knowledge on chemical reactions to let us make informed decisions.<br>
- **Protein-Protein Interaction**: Basics of protein-protein interactions (PPI's) implemented in Rosetta, which is a protein modeling/design software.<br>
- **Hallucinating Scaffold**: Using Rosetta to generate _de novo_ enzymes that would bind to and have the catalytic activity of its native target enzymes.

## Getting Started
To get started, [click here](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Figematberkeley%2Fcompbio-badges&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fcompbio-badges%2F0-welcome.ipynb&branch=master) to get the latest version of all the badges into your instance of [UC Berkeley's Datahub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/). From there, navigate to the corresponding badge folder (badge-XXX) and open the jupyter notebook. You can do the tasks there natively in the notebook, and follow any instructions to submit/check your results once you're done.
